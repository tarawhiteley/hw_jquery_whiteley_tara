## Resources

- I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Deductions
- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- This assignment helped me gain some confidence back after the last assignment! This one was quite fun. I had some minor trouble getting the code just right, but starting in the dev tools console really helped with that.
